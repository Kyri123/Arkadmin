Please see the patch notes for more details on the changes in the latest update.\r\n[/b]\r\n\r\nUltra Stacks is a stacking mod for ARK Evolved.  I know there are quite a few stacking mods out there, but the goal of this mod is to provide the best stacking experience possible to make the game more enjoyable.  Also, my goal is the keep updating this mod as soon as possible, and for as long as possible.  I know a lot of players get upset when mods don't get updated.  I will always do my best to ensure this mod is updated as soon as a new Ark Dev Kit is released.  \r\n\r\nNot only does this stacking mod change the quantity and weight of items, changes have also been made to some of the spoiling times as well.  Most spoiling times have been doubled, and other items have their spoiling time increased even more (e.g. prime meats).\r\n\r\nIf you are not adding Ultra Stacks to a new server, players may have to relearn their engrams before the stacking changes take effect.  This issue will not occur if you are adding Ultra Stacks to a new or wiped server.\r\n\r\nThis mod is completely stackable, but it is not compatible with any other stacking mods (you should only be using one stacking mod on your server to avoid complications).\r\n\r\nWorks with multiplayer and single player servers.  Also includes stackable items for Extinction, Scorched Earth & Aberration DLCs.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: For server owners who are experiencing the Iguanodon seeding issue when using stack mods, it can now be fixed by using the following mod below with this stack mod:\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092349650]Iguanodon Seed Trainer[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/761535755/343786195665849110/][h1]Click here for updated stack amounts, weight, and spoiling times for Ultra Stacks[/h1][/url]\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/761535755/343786195665608709/][h1]Click here for updated patch notes[/h1][/url]\r\n\r\nThis mod/code/work is protected by the [URL=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode]Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Creative Commons License.[/URL]","time_created":1473545590,"time_updated":1544499720,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":1138320,"favorited":14537,"lifetime_subscriptions":1611461,"lifetime_favorited":16976,"views":374690,"tags":[{"tag":"Mod"}]}]}}
