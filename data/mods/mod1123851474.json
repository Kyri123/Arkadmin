The best way you can support me is by donating!\r\n[url=https://www.patreon.com/Tbjbu2][img]http://image.prntscr.com/image/c2d097778ef845958cee40b1d44a5f81.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://logicservers.com][h1][b]Server Hosting Provided By LogicServers[/b][/h1]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Q2e624v.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[b]I'm doing mods by request, if you want me to make you a custom mod (paid) join this server and send me a private server with more details on what you want! https://discord.gg/DNuUn5N[/b]\r\n\r\nAdds a potion that will fix your dino - will make it rideable, breedable, and more!\r\nShould work with all dinos and 100% stackable with other mods! (So for example you will be able to use Classic Flyers + be able to breed Griffins)\r\nIt will also randomize the gender again so if you want to change your creatures' gender you can.\r\n\r\n[b]- If you do it on something that doesn't have a sex to start with. Put 1 in 1 of them, which will make it a female, then put 2 in the second one which will make it a male. If you use Super Spyglass, you can see the new updated sex on them. That's the only way to view them.[/b]\r\n- Works on modded & DLC creatures.\r\n- If you are on a server you wont actually see the gender change or the mating bar but it still technically works.\r\n- If the dino doesnt have a gender at start it should first be a female. Just enable wondering and see when the dinos start to have the love heart icon.\r\n- It doesnt make all dinos rideable, this feature was built to work only on specific dinos. The other features should work on all dinos though.\r\n\r\nEngramEntry_FixDinoPotion\r\nPrimalItemConsumable_FixDinoPotion\r\n\r\nMod ID: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=[b]1123851474[/b]\r\n\r\nDISCORD SERVER: https://discord.gg/CAQAsym","time_created":1504102725,"time_updated":1509735133,"visibility":0,"banned":0,"ban_reason":"","subscriptions":23968,"favorited":523,"lifetime_subscriptions":45697,"lifetime_favorited":620,"views":20420,"tags":[]}]}}
