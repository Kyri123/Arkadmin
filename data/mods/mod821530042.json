Even works with items from other mods! Can also salvage items for resources.\r\n\r\n[b]This mod doesn't change any core files and is stackable with other mods (see below).[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]... Yes, it works with TEK armor![/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Attention![/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Rocket Launchers & Tek Rifles[/b]\r\n\r\nVanilla rocket launchers and TEK rifles can't be upgraded. However, I have created a small companion mod that allows you to replace your vanilla rocket launcher with an upgradeable one.\r\n\r\nFeel free to sub to the \"Classic Rocket Launchers\" mod if you'd like to be able to upgrade your rocket launchers! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884380337\r\n\r\nWe may do the same for Tek rifles in the future.\r\n\r\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\r\n\r\nWeapons, armor, tools, and saddles from other mods can be upgraded and/or salvaged as long as the mod author has used the appropriate item as a starting point for their items (Hatchet for \"Super Hatchet\", Boots for \"Tek Boots\", etc).\r\n\r\nWhile I can try my best to ensure items from other mods can be upgraded and salvaged I can't control what other mod authors do in their mods. When in doubt, put this mod last in the load order. :)\r\n\r\nThe Upgrade Station can upgrade all items from any mod as long as the item has an upgrade path. Items that don't have an upgrade path (C4, Tripwire, Wooden Spear, etc) cannot be upgraded because they don't have a quality index. Some items, like the Builder's Helmet, will identify as being valid to upgrade but won't actually upgrade in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\n[h1]Version[/h1]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.8i has been released! This update should fix the crashes that result from multiple players attempting to upgrade/salvage/blueprint/augment the same item. For more information, please see the Version 1.8i Release Notes.\r\n\r\n[h1]Highly Configurable[/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you're finding upgrade requirements to be too low for your liking please note that the upgrade formula is completely configurable via INI settings. Please read this discussion for more info as well as a link to the formula to give you an idea how it works: http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/821530042/152392786911200641/\r\n\r\n[h1]Latest Updates[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Fixed armor stat bug.
